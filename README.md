# E-to-C-Programs-Translator (Winter 2016)

Wrote a Java program that translates E programs to their semantically equivalent C programs (not C++). That is, the input to our program — henceforth, the translator is an E program; the output from our program is a C program — henceforth, the generated code, or simply GC.
